==============================================================================================================

TRAINING CATEGORIES EXPLAINED:
  * Become Natural: Players with good ability who should train to reach Natural (18+) familiarity
  * Improve Natural: Players already Natural but need to improve their ability through training
  * Learn Position: Players with potential who should train into a new position

TRAINING TIMELINE EXPECTATIONS:
  * Competent level (10/20):  6-9 months of training + match experience
  * Accomplished level (13+): 12 months of training + regular playing time
  * Natural level (18+):      12-24 months (requires consistent matches)

KEY FACTORS FOR FASTER TRAINING:
  * Age under 24 (younger players learn faster)
  * High Versatility attribute (accelerates position learning)
  * High Professionalism (trains harder and more effectively)
  * Natural in similar positions (easier to adapt)
  * Both individual training AND match experience needed
