# Archived Research Documents

This directory contains superseded research documents from the early stages of the FM26 Lineup Optimizer project.

## Why These Are Archived

The documents in this folder were foundational drafts that have been **superseded by the comprehensive 12-step research program** documented in the parent directory.

## Current Authoritative Sources

For current specifications, refer to:
- `../00-PROGRESS-TRACKER.md` - Research program overview (12/12 steps complete)
- `../12-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` - Consolidated specifications and parameters
- `../01-RESULTS-fm26-mechanics.md` through `../11-RESULTS-calibration.md` - Individual research findings

## Contents

| File | Original Purpose | Superseded By |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| `FM26 #1 - System spec + decision model (foundation).md` | Initial OR framework draft | Steps 1-4 of new research |

## Note

These files are preserved for historical reference only. Do not use parameters or formulas from these documents - they contain outdated values that have been corrected in the new research program.
