# FM26 Rotation Guide for Brixham AFC's Promotion Push

## The 85% rule: Your most important threshold

**Never field players below 85% condition.** This single number represents the critical inflection point where FM26's injury risk spikes dramatically and performance suffers noticeably. Multiple expert sources, community testing, and official game mechanics all converge on this threshold. Players consistently below 85% risk poor displays or long-term injuries that can derail your promotion campaign. Some experienced managers use an even stricter 90% threshold for crucial matches, but 85% represents the absolute minimum safety line you should respect religiously.

FM26 released on November 4, 2025, with significant changes to its injury system due to the new Unity engine transition. The community has reported catastrophic injury frequencies—users experiencing 8+ injuries within two months of gameplay, with 2-4 injuries occurring every four days. While Sports Interactive is actively patching these issues, this makes proper rotation even more critical for your save. The fatigue system itself carries over from previous versions but with more punishing consequences for mismanagement.

## Understanding FM26's three fatigue systems

FM26 tracks player readiness through three interconnected but distinct systems: **condition** (your player's current energy level shown as a percentage), **match sharpness** (competitive readiness gained only through actual match minutes), and **jadedness** (a hidden burnout metric that only becomes visible when critical). Condition fluctuates daily based on matches, training, and recovery. It drops during matches based on Stamina, Work Rate, and tactical intensity, then recovers between games depending on the player's Natural Fitness attribute. Match sharpness cannot be improved through training alone—players need actual competitive minutes to build and maintain it. When sharp, players perform better and their condition drops more slowly during matches. Jadedness accumulates from playing too many matches with insufficient rest, causing condition to drop faster in games and recover more slowly between them. Young players and those over 30 become jaded more easily.

The Medical Centre provides comprehensive monitoring tools to track all three systems. Check the Risk Assessment tab weekly to see each player's match load (last 14 days), training load, condition percentage, match sharpness level, and overall injury risk categorization. When players show "RST" (rest needed) icons, they've crossed the jadedness threshold and need immediate extended rest regardless of their condition percentage.

## Your systematic rotation framework for Level 7-8

Managing at Regional Premier Division level presents unique challenges. You're working with 18-20 usable players compared to 25 at higher levels, facing budget constraints that prevent stockpiling talent, and dealing with part-time players who may have less optimal recovery due to working other jobs. Your rotation strategy must be pragmatic, not idealistic.

**Target two quality players per position minimum**, accepting that backups may be one star lower in ability. Prioritize depth investment in central midfield (the engine room requires fresh legs most), strikers (having two quality forwards prevents burnout), and center-backs (injuries here can derail seasons). Use the loan market aggressively—it's virtually impossible to bring in the caliber of player on permanent deals that you can secure temporarily. Target Championship and League One U21 players, request the parent club cover 50-100% of wages, and accept recall clauses since you need immediate help rather than long-term certainty.

**Keep your tactics simple and direct.** Avoid Gegenpress at this level—your players lack the fitness for 90-minute high-intensity pressing, and community evidence shows it causes fatigue crises by October in lower leagues. Stick to straightforward 4-4-2 or 4-2-3-1 formations with moderate pressing triggers. Direct football suits lower league players better than possession-based approaches. Train a secondary low-intensity tactic (possession style with minimal pressing) to switch to when protecting leads or managing accumulated fatigue.

## Match frequency and congestion management

Players can sustain approximately **25-30 matches per season** comfortably, with 2,520 minutes representing optimal playing time. The absolute maximum before significant fatigue issues emerge is 36 matches. During normal weekly schedules with one match, minimal rotation is needed if players maintain above 85% condition. When facing two matches per week, rotate 3-4 players between games. During three-match weeks, rotate 5-6 players or employ two complete squads if your depth allows.

Critical fatigue periods occur predictably. **October-November** brings intensified league fixtures, overlapping cup competitions, and the first major injury wave—monitor your Medical Centre weekly during this window. **December-January** features the Christmas fixture pile-up with Boxing Day and New Year's matches compressed into days, making advance rotation planning essential. **March-April** represents your final promotion push when accumulated fatigue peaks and tired legs cost points in the run-in. Reduce training intensity to minimum during this period, prioritizing recovery over development since fresh legs matter more than tactical refinement.

## Training intensity: Never exceed Medium

Set all players' training intensity to **Automatic** and configure your Training Rest settings to adjust workload based on condition automatically. Players showing red/low condition hearts should receive no pitch or gym work (recovery only). Yellow condition hearts warrant half intensity training. Only players at peak condition (green hearts) should train at normal or double intensity. The single most important rule: **training intensity should never exceed Medium during the regular season**. Heavy workload causes excessive injuries and slower attribute development. Keep coaching workload at Light or Average across all categories.

Structure your weekly training with rest or light recovery immediately after matches (three rest sessions recommended on day one post-match), then gradually increase intensity mid-week, peaking two days after the match when players have recovered. As the next match approaches, taper intensity back down. On two-match weeks, avoid intensity peaks entirely—keep everything at recovery or light technical work. Players over 32 years old should be set to Normal intensity manually rather than Automatic, as they require more careful management to avoid excessive fatigue.

Pre-season can feature heavier physical focus with lots of Endurance, Resistance, and Quickness sessions to build your fitness base. However, community reports suggest that excessively heavy pre-season training correlates with September injury crises, so moderate your approach and ensure players enter the competitive season with good match sharpness rather than pure physical exhaustion.

## Position and role-specific rotation patterns

FM26 doesn't provide explicit position-specific fatigue multipliers, but tactical roles create dramatically different physical demands. **High-fatigue roles** requiring rotation every 2-3 games during congested periods include Box-to-Box Midfielders covering the entire pitch, Pressing Forwards and Wide Forwards constantly pressing and moving, and Wing-Backs on Attack duty with massive running demands. **Moderate-fatigue roles** like Central Midfielders on Support, Full-Backs on Defend duty, and Inside Forwards can play 3-4 consecutive games if condition stays above 85%. **Lower-fatigue roles** including Central Defenders (especially Stoppers), Goalkeepers, and Deep-Lying Playmakers with limited movement can handle consecutive games more easily.

Tactical intensity matters more than position. Using Gegenpress or High Press with Counter-Press increases fatigue across all positions by roughly 20-30%. Higher tempo, more closing down, and higher lines of engagement all accelerate condition loss. When you're winning comfortably after 70 minutes, switch to your low-intensity possession tactic to preserve energy. Don't waste high-intensity pressing when protecting leads.

## Age-related rotation requirements

Young players between **15-18 years** develop mainly through training quality rather than match exposure, though they become jaded more easily than players in their prime. Don't overburden them with heavy individual training workloads. Players **18-23 years old** progress faster through matches than training—aim for 25-30 matches per season for optimal development while monitoring their condition closely. At this level, use youth players as rotation options in cup matches, when 2+ goals ahead after 60 minutes, and as substitutes in the final 15-20 minutes. Give promising youth 10-20 substitute appearances rather than full starts initially to integrate them gradually.

Players **over 30 years** require more careful management. Set their training intensity to Normal rather than Automatic or Double. Physical decline begins around 32, though improved mental attributes can offset this. Increase rotation frequency after 32, and expect significant drop-off after 35 in possession and dueling abilities. Players with high Natural Fitness and Professionalism personalities decline more slowly and can sustain heavier workloads longer.

## Your competition prioritization hierarchy

Focus **80% of your energy on league performance**—promotion is the ultimate goal, determines budget increases, and builds squad confidence. The FA Trophy/FA Vase deserves 15% focus for prize money significant to lower league budgets, but never sacrifice league form for cup glory. County Cups merit just 5% attention, serving purely as rotation opportunities where you field fringe players and youth for full matches.

If you're mid-table by December, field full-strength teams in cups for revenue. If you're in a promotion race, heavily rotate cup squads to protect league form. If facing relegation, prioritize league exclusively and rest everyone possible in cups. At Level 7-8, draws away from home are good results—be pragmatic and save your strongest XI for home matches where you're expected to win.

## Match day execution and substitutions

Check condition percentages before every match and enforce the 85% rule ruthlessly. Make substitutions at **60-70 minutes** for players below 85% condition rather than waiting for performance to drop. When winning comfortably, substitute at 60-65 minutes to conserve energy for upcoming fixtures. Always substitute immediately if any player shows an injury indicator at half-time. Listen to your physio's recommendations about player readiness—if they say a player is only fit for 45 minutes or is tired, follow that advice rather than overriding it.

During matches, make in-game tactical adjustments to reduce fatigue when protecting leads: lower tempo one notch, enable Hold Shape to prevent excessive pressing, switch tackling to Stay on Feet, and enable time wasting to prioritize possession retention. Limit maximum role changes to three per match to maintain tactical familiarity, and only adjust sliders one place forward or backward maximum.

## Season-long management timeline

**August-September**: Establish your first XI with minimal rotation to build confidence and tactical cohesion. Don't rotate in opening weeks—you need consistency to develop team understanding. Assess squad depth gaps and begin scouting loan targets for the winter window.

**October-November**: Introduce rotation for the first time as fixtures intensify. Monitor injury trends closely in your Medical Centre. Reduce training intensity 10-15% as the first congestion period arrives. Rotate in September domestic cups to keep fringe players sharp.

**December-January**: Maximum rotation period with Christmas fixture pile-up. Plan for every fixture individually, potentially rotating 5-6 players per match during the busiest weeks. Use the winter transfer window for emergency loans if injury crises hit. Give players 2-3 days rest after international breaks if applicable at your level.

**February-March**: Identify your best 14 players who will carry the promotion push. Return to a more consistent XI but rest players strategically before matches against top-6 rivals. This is where your depth investment pays dividends as opponents' squads tire.

**April-May**: Play your strongest team every match if in a promotion race. Rotate only when mathematically safe. Reduce training to absolute minimum—recovery matters exponentially more than improvement now. Set both red hearts to no pitch/gym work and yellow hearts to half intensity for these crucial final weeks.

## Your systematic daily and weekly checklist

**Before every match**, verify all starters exceed 85% condition, check for any "Rst" jadedness icons, confirm key players haven't played 3+ consecutive games during congested periods, and assess opponent difficulty to identify rotation opportunities against weaker sides.

**After every match**, give all starters one full day of rest (two days if they played 70+ minutes), review physio recommendations versus current training intensity settings, manually adjust any mismatches until recommendations disappear, and review your upcoming fixture list to plan rotation needs.

**Weekly reviews** should check coaching workload remains Light or Average, examine Medical Centre risk assessments for players flagged as high injury risk, identify players approaching fatigue thresholds before they cross them, plan next week's training intensity based on fixture density, and adjust your training schedule for congested periods.

**Monthly assessments** include praising players with 7.5+ training ratings and criticizing those below 6.5, reviewing squad playing time distribution to ensure everyone gets sufficient minutes, assessing whether your rotation strategy is working by tracking injury rates and performance trends, and identifying if loan or free agent reinforcements are needed.

## Your definitive rotation rules

Implement these systematically and review them after every match:

**Condition Management Rules**: Never start players below 85% condition. Use 90% as your threshold for crucial matches. Rest anyone showing 80% or below immediately. Give all starters one day of complete rest after matches. Monitor condition daily, not just match days.

**Match Frequency Rules**: Rotate high-intensity role players every 2-3 games during congestion. Moderate-intensity roles can play 3-4 consecutive matches if maintaining 85%+ condition. Never play the same XI more than two consecutive games when facing three matches per week. Plan rotation before big matches rather than resting players afterward—rest key players against weaker opponents to keep them fresh for crucial games.

**Training Rules**: Use Automatic intensity for all players except those 32+. Never exceed Medium training intensity during the season. Keep workload Light or Average across all coaching categories. Set red condition hearts to no pitch/gym work. Peak training intensity two days post-match, then taper. Reduce overall intensity from October onwards as fixtures increase.

**Squad Structure Rules**: Maintain 18-20 first team players at Level 7-8 (two per position). Invest heavily in loan market for quality depth. Use free agents and short contracts for budget sustainability. Fill all medical staff slots, prioritizing Sports Scientists with 12+ Physiotherapy and Physios with 15+ Physiotherapy attributes.

**Age-Specific Rules**: Players 18-23 need 25-30 matches per season for optimal development. Players 30-32 need gradually increased rotation frequency. Players 32+ require manual Normal intensity training and significant rotation. Youth under 18 should focus on training quality over match exposure.

FM26's enhanced fatigue system punishes carelessness but rewards systematic management. The 85% condition threshold, Automatic training intensity, strategic use of loans for depth, simple tactical approaches, and proactive rotation planning will carry Brixham AFC through the Regional Premier Division toward your Premier League dream. Implement these rules consistently, trust your Medical Centre data, and your promotion push will be built on fresh legs rather than fatigued failures.
