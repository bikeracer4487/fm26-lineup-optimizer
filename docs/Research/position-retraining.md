## Position Retraining in Football Manager 2026: Age, Attributes, and Training Timeline

Position retraining in Football Manager 2026 is a nuanced system influenced by multiple player characteristics and requires both dedicated training and match experience. Here's what you need to know about how different factors affect a player's ability to learn new positions and how long the process takes.

### The Versatility Hidden Attribute: The Primary Factor

The most critical determinant of position retraining speed is the **Versatility** hidden attribute, which ranges from 1-20 like all FM attributes. This hidden stat governs both how quickly a player learns new positions through training and how well they adapt when played out of position.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

Players with high Versatility (15-20) will learn new positions significantly faster than those with low Versatility (1-10). Unfortunately, Versatility cannot be viewed without using the editor or third-party tools, and it doesn't appear in any coach or scout reports. This makes it impossible to gauge during regular gameplay, creating some uncertainty when deciding which players to retrain.[^5][^2][^1]

The impact is substantial: players with low Versatility may struggle to adapt to a new position at all, while highly versatile players can become accomplished in a matter of months.[^2][^1]

### Age and Position Learning

**Younger players adapt to new positions faster than older players**. The general consensus suggests:[^6][^7][^8]

- **Under 24**: Peak developmental years where position retraining is most effective and fastest
- **18-24**: Players still have significant capacity to learn new positions
- **24+**: Position retraining becomes slower and more difficult
- **28+**: While still possible, retraining takes considerably longer

That said, age isn't an absolute barrier—older players can still successfully retrain, it simply requires more patience and time. The key advantage younger players have is that they're still developing their overall attributes, so the training focus on a new position doesn't significantly hinder their broader development.[^8][^9]

### Mental Attributes and Personality Traits

While not as impactful as Versatility, certain mental attributes and personality traits influence position retraining success:

**Professionalism** is the most important hidden attribute for overall player development. Players with high Professionalism (18-20) train harder and more consistently, which accelerates all aspects of improvement including position learning. Research shows that a player with 20 Professionalism will develop approximately 46 CA points over three years, compared to just 22 points for someone with 10 Determination and 10 Professionalism.[^10][^11][^12][^13][^14]

**Determination** and **Ambition** also contribute to development, though less significantly than Professionalism. Players with strong work ethic personalities like "Model Citizen," "Professional," "Resolute," or "Driven" will generally retrain positions more effectively.[^11][^12][^10]

**Adaptability** helps players settle into new situations more quickly, which can assist when adjusting to unfamiliar tactical demands.[^4][^15]

### Position Similarity and Familiarity Levels

The similarity between a player's current position and the new position dramatically affects retraining time:[^16][^5][^6]

**Similar positions** (e.g., left back to right back, winger to wing-back, central midfielder to defensive midfielder) retrain much faster because they share similar attribute weightings. The more overlap in key attributes between positions, the less CA adjustment is required.[^17][^18][^5][^16]

**Distant positions** (e.g., striker to central defender) take much longer and cause more significant attribute adjustments. When retraining to a vastly different position, the game recalculates attribute weightings based on both positions, which can cause some attribute values to decrease as CA is redistributed.[^19][^20][^5][^17][^16]

**Existing familiarity** accelerates the process. If a player already has some familiarity with a position (Competent, Awkward, etc.), they'll learn it faster than starting from zero.[^7][^5]

The positional familiarity levels in FM26 are:[^21][^22][^6]

- **Natural** (19-20): Best performance level
- **Accomplished** (green): Suitable for regular play
- **Competent** (yellow-green): Adequate for rotation
- **Unconvincing** (yellow): Temporary fill-in
- **Awkward** (orange): Emergency use only
- **Ineffectual**: Cannot play this position effectively

Research indicates that position familiarity is "free" (no CA cost) up to level 10, but begins affecting CA distribution and attribute weightings from level 11 onwards.[^23][^16]

### Timeline for Position Retraining

The consensus from the FM community and testing provides these general timelines:[^6][^7]

**From zero familiarity to Accomplished**: Approximately **6-9 months** with regular training focus[^6]

**From Accomplished to Natural**: Approximately **12 months total** from the start of training[^24][^6]

**Overall timeline**: Most sources suggest **1-2 years** to fully master a completely new position and achieve Natural status, though this varies significantly based on:[^24][^6]

- Versatility attribute
- Age of the player
- How often they play in the new position
- Individual training time allocation
- Position similarity


### Training and Match Experience Requirements

Position retraining requires both dedicated training AND match experience:[^25][^7][^6]

**Individual Training**: Set the player's individual training focus to the specific position and role you want them to learn. Avoid additional focuses (like traits or extra attribute work) during retraining as these slow the process.[^25][^6]

**Match Time**: Playing time in the new position is essential—training alone isn't enough. The recommendation is to gradually introduce the player:[^7][^25][^6]

1. Start with friendlies and pre-season matches
2. Progress to cup games
3. Eventually integrate into competitive fixtures[^6]

Aim for approximately **15+ matches per season** in the new position for effective learning. Some sources suggest playing the position regularly (as a starter) accelerates learning significantly.[^26][^27][^28][^8][^7]

**General Training Schedules**: Use training schedules that incorporate "Individual Roles," "Attacking Movement," "Defensive Shape," and "Match Practice" sessions to support position-specific development.[^29][^25]

### Current Ability (CA) Considerations

When a player learns a new position, attribute weightings are recalculated based on both their old and new positions. This can cause:[^20][^5][^17][^16][^23]

- Minor decreases in some attributes (typically 1-2 points) as CA redistributes[^5][^19]
- The effect is minimal for similar positions (e.g., left-right conversions)[^17][^19]
- More significant for distant positions (striker to defender)[^16][^5]

The CA "cost" of learning positions is primarily incurred between familiarity levels 11-16, with most of the cost happening in this range. Going from Accomplished to Natural is relatively "cheap" in CA terms.[^23][^16]

### Optimization Strategies

To maximize position retraining effectiveness in FM26:[^9][^8][^6]

1. **Start early**: Begin retraining younger players (under 24) when possible
2. **Prioritize Versatility**: Try to identify versatile players through trial and error or scout for players who already have some familiarity with multiple positions
3. **Remove other training distractions**: Stop additional focus training and trait learning during position retraining
4. **Provide consistent game time**: Even as a substitute for 20-25 minutes helps[^1]
5. **Use mentoring groups**: Place the retraining player in a mentoring group with natural players in that position to accelerate learning[^9]
6. **Choose similar positions first**: If you need a player to cover multiple positions, start with the most similar position to their natural role
7. **Monitor workload**: Adding position training increases training workload, which can make players unhappy[^5]

### FM26-Specific Changes

FM26 has introduced enhanced position and role training capabilities, with players now able to become more competent in new positions and roles more quickly than in previous versions. The game now emphasizes both "In Possession" and "Out of Possession" role training, giving you greater control over tactical development.[^30][^31][^32]

Players can now achieve Natural status in new roles more readily, and the tactical familiarity system has been refined to better reflect individual player development within your specific tactical setup.[^31]

In conclusion, position retraining in FM26 depends heavily on the hidden Versatility attribute, with younger players and those with high Professionalism learning fastest. Expect 6-9 months to reach Accomplished level and up to 12-24 months total for Natural status, assuming consistent training focus and regular match experience in the new position. Similar positions retrain much faster than distant ones, and the process requires both dedicated individual training and actual playing time to be effective.
