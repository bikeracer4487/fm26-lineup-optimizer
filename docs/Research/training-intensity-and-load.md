# Research training intensity and training load in Football Manager 2026. How do they affect players? What are the best settings and the best load level to aim for for players? If there are different optimum levels for different kinds/ages of players, what are they? How is training load affected? What kinds of training and options affect training load?

Now I have comprehensive information about training intensity and training load in FM26. Let me compile this into a detailed research report.

## Training Intensity and Training Load in Football Manager 2026

### Understanding Training Intensity

Training intensity in FM26 controls how hard individual players train and directly affects their development, injury risk, and physical condition. The intensity settings available are:[^1][^2]

**Intensity Levels:**

- **No Pitch or Gym Work** - Players rest completely from physical training
- **Half Intensity** - Reduced training load
- **Normal Intensity** - Standard training load
- **Double Intensity** - Maximum training load

**Automatic vs. Manual Settings:**
You can set training intensity to "Automatic" which allows the game to adjust intensity based on player condition, or manually control each player's intensity level. Most experienced managers recommend setting intensity to Automatic for convenience, but fine-tuning the automatic settings under Training > Rest.[^3][^2][^4][^1]

### Recommended Training Intensity Settings

The consensus among FM26 experts is to configure your automatic intensity rules as follows:[^2][^4]

**Optimal Auto-Intensity Configuration:**

1. **Condition 1 (Very Low Fitness)**: No pitch or gym work
2. **Condition 2 (Low Fitness)**: No pitch or gym work
3. **Condition 3 (Below Average)**: No pitch or gym work
4. **Condition 4 (Average Fitness)**: Half intensity
5. **Condition 5 (Fully Fit)**: Normal intensity or Double intensity

**Key principle**: Keep training intensity at or below Medium during the season. Only players who are fully fit should train at normal or double intensity.[^4][^1]

### Training Intensity by Player Age

Different age groups require different intensity approaches:[^5][^2]

**Young Players (16-21):**

- Can handle double intensity training when fully fit
- Ages 15-18 are the "golden age" for development[^6]
- Physical attributes grow fastest during this period
- Be cautious with players who have low Natural Fitness[^7]

**Prime Age Players (22-27):**

- Normal to double intensity when fully fit
- Most versatile in terms of training tolerance
- Development continues but slows after age 22[^5]

**Veterans (28-31):**

- Normal intensity recommended
- Can still develop but at reduced rates
- Monitor condition closely during congested fixtures

**Older Players (32+):**

- **Normal intensity maximum**[^2]
- Avoid double intensity to reduce injury risk
- Physical decline accelerates after age 30[^5]
- Consider half intensity during busy periods


### How Training Load is Affected

Training load is determined by multiple factors that combine to create the overall workload for players:

**Factors Affecting Individual Training Load:**

1. **Team Training Schedule**: The number and type of training sessions scheduled each week[^8][^1]
2. **Individual Training Focus**: Position/Role/Duty training for both In and Out of Possession[^1]
3. **Additional Focus**: Extra attribute training (e.g., Quickness, Shooting)[^9][^10]
4. **Player Traits**: Learning new traits adds significantly to workload[^11]
5. **Position Training**: Learning new positions increases workload[^11]
6. **Training Intensity**: Double intensity roughly doubles the effect on attributes but also increases workload[^11]

**Coach Workload vs. Player Workload:**
These are separate concepts. Coach workload refers to how thinly spread your coaching staff is across training categories. You should aim for **Light or Average** coach workload by assigning multiple coaches to each category. Heavy coach workload lowers session quality and slows player growth.[^12][^13][^14][^1]

### Best Training Load Levels for Players

The optimal training load depends on several player-specific factors:

**Target Training Load: Light to Average**[^1]

**Factors to Consider:**

1. **Professionalism**: Players with Professionalism 20 develop twice as fast as those with Professionalism 10. High professionalism players can handle heavier workloads.[^15]
2. **Natural Fitness**: This attribute determines how well players maintain physical attributes and recover between sessions. Players with high Natural Fitness (15+) can handle more intense training.[^7]
3. **Injury Susceptibility**: Players with high injury susceptibility should have reduced training loads and lower intensity.[^16][^17]
4. **Determination**: Affects mental resilience and ability to handle demanding training.[^18]
5. **Current Fitness Level**: Players below full fitness should have reduced intensity.[^3][^4]

### Training Load Management by Session Type

Different training sessions contribute differently to injury risk and player development:[^19][^8]

**Recovery vs. Rest:**

- **Recovery sessions** are superior to Rest for most purposes[^20][^19]
- Recovery improves injury risk and match sharpness[^20]
- Rest improves condition and fatigue but does NOT reduce injury risk[^20]
- Use Recovery sessions after every match[^21][^22]

**Match Sharpness:**
Match sharpness is critically important - the difference between 90% and 100% sharpness equals a 33% difference in win rate. Players need regular game time to maintain sharpness. Friendly matches provide up to 5% sharpness gain per 90 minutes, while competitive matches provide up to 9%.[^23]

**Recovery Mechanics:**

- Three Rest sessions in one day without any other training provides maximum fatigue recovery (approximately 137-152 points)[^19]
- Recovery sessions recover about half the fatigue of Rest sessions but maintain match sharpness[^19]
- One Recovery session per day is most efficient[^19]


### Optimal Weekly Training Structure

The current FM26 "meta" training approach prioritizes physical attribute development:[^24][^25][^15]

**Meta Training Schedule:**

- 7x Recovery sessions
- 1x Quickness session
- 1x Match Practice session
- 1x Attacking session (optional)
- Additional Focus: Quickness for all outfield players[^25][^10]
- Training Intensity: Double intensity for fully fit players[^25]

**Benefits:**

- Maximizes development of Pace and Acceleration (critical attributes)[^10]
- Reduces injury risk through Recovery sessions[^26]
- Maintains match sharpness through Match Practice[^23]

**Alternative Balanced Approach:**
If you want more balanced development without sacrificing technical/mental attributes:[^27]

- Reduce or eliminate Quickness sessions
- Add more Overall or Attacking/Defensive sessions
- Consider removing Additional Focus Quickness
- Keep double intensity but apply it more selectively


### Training Intensity During Different Periods

**Pre-Season (6-8 weeks):**[^28][^29]

- Week 1: Average intensity, fitness focus
- Weeks 2-3: High intensity, fitness focus
- Week 4: Very High intensity, fitness focus
- Weeks 5-6: High intensity, tactical/team cohesion focus
- Heavy pre-season training allows lighter training during the season[^30]

**Regular Season (1 match per week):**

- Normal to double intensity for fully fit players
- Balance between development and match preparation
- Keep training at or below Medium intensity overall[^1]

**Congested Fixtures (2+ matches per week):**[^31][^32]

- Reduce training intensity significantly
- Prioritize Recovery sessions after each match
- Consider giving key players 1-3 days complete rest[^21]
- Accept lower team cohesion temporarily to preserve fitness


### Training Intensity and Injury Risk

Research shows a direct correlation between training intensity and injury frequency:[^33][^8]

**Key Findings:**

- No training: Minimal injuries, but physical attributes naturally grow while technical/mental decline[^15]
- Normal training: Moderate development, acceptable injury rates
- 18 sessions per week with high intensity: Significantly more injuries[^8]
- Double intensity training: Can double injury-related missed days (999 days vs. 499 days over 3 seasons)[^33]

**However**, injuries in training are relatively rare if you:[^26]

- Use Recovery sessions liberally
- Respect player condition levels
- Monitor injury-prone players closely
- Adjust intensity based on fixture congestion


### The Training Development Paradox

Recent research reveals that training in FM26 (and previous versions) works differently than most players assume:[^34][^15]

**Key Insight:** Training doesn't add new Current Ability (CA) - it **redistributes** CA weight to specific attributes. Match experience is what actually increases CA. This means:[^15]

- Playing 20-30 matches per season is essential for development[^35][^5]
- Training shapes how that CA is distributed across attributes
- Physical training early (ages 15-18) unlocks growth caps for pace/acceleration[^6]
- Without matches, technical and mental attributes naturally decline[^15]


### Player Complaints and Happiness

Players may complain about training intensity and workload:[^36][^37]

**Common Complaints:**

- "Too much [specific training type]" or "Not enough [specific training type]"
- Training intensity too high or too low
- Individual workload too heavy

**Solutions:**[^36]

- Adjust Additional Focus to address specific complaints
- Modify training intensity by one level
- Ensure all coaching positions are filled to avoid quality complaints[^36]
- Balance individual training elements (traits, positions, focus)
- Ignore minor complaints if the training strategy is working[^38]


### Practical Recommendations

**For Maximum Development:**

1. Set training intensity to Automatic with the configuration: No Pitch/No Pitch/No Pitch/Half/Double[^4]
2. Use the meta training schedule (Recovery + Quickness + Match Practice)[^25]
3. Add Quickness as Additional Focus for outfield players[^10]
4. Ensure players get 20-30 competitive matches per season[^35]
5. Keep coach workload at Light or Average[^13][^1]

**For Injury Prevention:**

1. Use Recovery sessions after every match[^21]
2. Monitor Medical Center for high injury risk players[^21]
3. Give manual rest (1-7 days) to players with Heavy match load[^21]
4. Reduce intensity during congested fixtures[^31]
5. Set older players (32+) to Normal intensity maximum[^2]

**For Balanced Development:**

1. Use fewer specialized training sessions
2. Include Overall, Attacking, and Defensive sessions
3. Consider removing Additional Focus Quickness for players once they reach target pace levels (15+ for CBs, 16+ for CMs, 17+ for wingers/strikers)[^39]
4. Balance between team cohesion, tactical familiarity, and individual development

The key to success in FM26 training is understanding that development comes primarily from match experience, while training shapes how that development is distributed. Intensity should be tailored to individual player characteristics (age, fitness, professionalism, natural fitness) rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach.
