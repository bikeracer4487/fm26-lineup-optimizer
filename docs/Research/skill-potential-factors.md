## Understanding Potential Ability (PA) and Player Development in Football Manager

The relationship between Potential Ability (PA), Current Ability (CA), and actual player improvement in Football Manager is complex and influenced by numerous factors beyond just the raw numbers. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of everything you need to know to effectively gauge how much a player can improve.

### The Core Mechanics: CA and PA

**Current Ability (CA)** represents a player's present skill level, while **Potential Ability (PA)** defines the theoretical maximum they can reach. Both values range from 0 to 200, with elite players like Lionel Messi sitting around 194-200. Critically, PA is fixed when a game starts and generally does not change during your save. A player's CA can never exceed their PA.[^1][^2][^3]

However, as you've correctly identified, a high PA doesn't guarantee a player will reach that ceiling. A 39-year-old with CA 100 and PA 200 is unlikely to improve significantly due to age-related limitations, even though theoretically 100 points of development remain.[^4][^5]

### Age and Development: The Critical Timeline

Age profoundly impacts a player's ability to develop and when they peak:

**Peak Development Years:**

- **Ages 15-18**: The most rapid growth period, with 17-18 being the peak growth age[^5]
- **Ages 19-23**: Development continues but slows considerably after age 19, with another slowdown at 23[^6][^4][^5]
- **Ages 24-27**: Players typically reach their maximum CA during this window, with most peaking around age 24[^7][^4]
- **Age 27+**: A key node where development significantly slows; growth becomes minimal[^5]

**Position-Specific Peak Ages:**[^4]

- Goalkeepers: 28 (range 27-31)
- Centre Backs: 27 (range 26-31)
- Full Backs: 25 (range 25-29)
- Central Midfielders: 25 (range 24-30)
- Wide Attackers: 26 (range 23-29)
- Strikers: 27 (range 24-29)


### Age-Related Decline

**Decline typically begins around age 30-32**, with physical attributes deteriorating faster than technical ones, while mental attributes remain largely stable. Players with high Natural Fitness and Professionalism decline more slowly and can remain competitive into their late 30s. However, the decline accelerates sharply after age 31, and by age 35, even intensive physical training struggles to prevent CA reduction.[^8][^9][^10][^11][^5]

Your example of a 39-year-old illustrates this perfectly: even with 100 CA remaining to reach their 200 PA, age-related decline would actively reduce their CA rather than allowing growth, making meaningful improvement essentially impossible.[^8][^5]

### The Key Factors Affecting Development

**1. Professionalism (Most Important Hidden Attribute)**

Professionalism is the single most critical factor in player development. Research shows:[^12][^13][^14]

- Players with **20 Professionalism** grow approximately **17 CA points per season**
- Players with **10 Professionalism** grow approximately **8.2 CA points per season**
- Players with **1 Professionalism** grow only **2.4 CA points per season**[^13]

This effect dwarfs even PA differences. A player with 200 PA but 10 Professionalism will develop slower than a player with 150 PA but 20 Professionalism, even with zero training.[^15][^12]

**2. Determination, Ambition, and Personality**

These three hidden attributes contribute equally to development progression scores. Key personality types for optimal development include Model Professional, Professional, Driven, Perfectionist, and Ambitious. Players under age 23-24 can have their personalities changed through mentoring, making this a crucial intervention point.[^16][^17][^18][^19][^12]

**3. Natural Fitness**

Natural Fitness determines how well players maintain physical attributes past their peak and how slowly they decline with age. High Natural Fitness allows players to continue improving into their 30s, while low Natural Fitness causes rapid physical decline after 30.[^9][^11]

**4. Training Quality and Intensity**

Training schedules significantly impact development, with some methods proving far more effective than others:

**Optimal Training Schedule (Current Meta):**[^20][^21][^15]

- 7x Recovery sessions
- 1x Quickness training
- 1x Match Practice
- 1x Attacking training
- Double intensity with Additional Focus on Quickness
- This can generate **12+ CA improvement per season** for young players with high Professionalism[^22][^15]

**Match Practice** is the single most effective training type for overall CA growth, providing approximately 4.6 attribute points per season—more than any other match preparation method. However, intensive training increases injury risk.[^23][^24]

**5. Playing Time and Match Experience**

**Playing competitive matches is essential** for reaching PA. Training alone cannot fully develop a player—they need actual game time. However, the quality and amount matter:[^25][^26][^27]

- **First-team minutes** are significantly more valuable than reserve or youth football[^28][^25]
- Players need approximately **15-20 minutes** to gain meaningful match experience[^29]
- **Overplaying young players (under 19)** can cause "burnout," where they reach their PA too quickly and then decline[^30][^31]
- Lack of playing time is the most common reason wonderkids fail to reach their potential[^26][^27]

**6. Training Facilities and Coaching Staff**

Better facilities and coaches accelerate development rates. State-of-the-art facilities help players reach their PA faster than basic facilities. Quality coaches are equally important—facilities provide the tools, but without expert coaching, development is hampered.[^32][^33]

**7. Injuries**

Long-term injuries (3+ months) can permanently impact development, particularly for young players. Injury-prone players (hidden attribute) may never reach their full PA due to constant setbacks. Physical attributes, especially pace and acceleration, rarely fully recover from serious injuries.[^34][^35][^36]

### Attribute Distribution and CA Cost

Not all attributes cost the same CA points, and this varies by position. For example:[^37][^38]

- Tackling is "expensive" (high CA cost) for defenders but "cheap" for strikers
- Finishing is expensive for strikers but cheap for defenders
- Pace and Acceleration have high CA costs for most positions and are weighted heavily in performance[^39][^40]
- Mental attributes generally cost less CA than physical or technical attributes[^37]

**When retraining positions**, players can see CA changes because different positions weight attributes differently. A striker converted to defender might see their CA drop initially because their finishing skill (cheap for strikers) becomes less valuable, while their tackling (expensive for defenders) needs improvement.[^41][^42]

### Warning Signs a Player Won't Reach Their Potential

1. **Age 23+ with large CA-PA gap**: If a player is 23 with 120 CA but 180 PA (60-point gap), they're unlikely to close that gap[^6][^7]
2. **Poor personality** (Unprofessional, Unambitious, Low Determination): Without intervention through mentoring, these players rarely develop[^17][^19][^16]
3. **Lack of playing time**: Rotting on the bench or in reserves will prevent development regardless of PA[^25][^26]
4. **Frequent injuries**: Injury-prone players miss crucial development time[^35][^34]
5. **Low Natural Fitness**: Will struggle to maintain development into mid-20s[^11]
6. **Poor training facilities**: Significantly limits development ceiling[^33]

### Practical Assessment Guidelines

To gauge a player's improvement potential, consider:

**High Potential for Improvement:**

- Age 16-21 with visible PA-CA gap
- High Professionalism (visible through "Model Professional," "Professional" personality)
- Getting regular first-team minutes
- Good Natural Fitness (if visible through scouting)
- Quality training facilities and coaches

**Moderate Potential for Improvement:**

- Age 22-26 with modest PA-CA gap (20-30 points)
- Decent personality traits
- Sporadic playing time
- Average facilities

**Low/No Potential for Improvement:**

- Age 27+ (unless small gap to PA)
- Age 30+ (decline likely beginning)
- Age 35+ (decline accelerating)
- Poor personality without mentoring options
- Chronic injury problems
- Large CA-PA gap at age 23+


### The Burnout Risk

Playing players **under age 19 too much** can cause them to reach their PA prematurely, then decline before establishing themselves. This "burnout" phenomenon means careful game-time management is crucial for teenagers—they should progress gradually from substitute appearances to regular starters around age 19-21.[^30]

### Negative PA Values

For players under 21, FM uses a random PA system with negative values:[^43][^30]

- **-10** = 170-200 PA (highest range)
- **-95** = 160-190 PA
- **-9** = 150-180 PA

This creates variability across saves, ensuring the same wonderkid doesn't always reach the same level.[^43]

### Conclusion

Your 39-year-old example perfectly illustrates that **PA represents potential, not destiny**. While that player theoretically has 100 CA points of room to grow, age-related decline mechanisms actively reduce CA at that age, making improvement impossible. The player needed to develop during their prime years (16-27) when biological factors, training responsiveness, and game-time opportunities align for growth.[^8][^4][^5]

To effectively gauge improvement potential, you must consider the holistic picture: age, personality attributes (especially Professionalism), playing time, training quality, injury history, and Natural Fitness—not just the PA number. A 21-year-old with 140 CA, 180 PA, Model Professional personality, and regular playing time will almost certainly reach their potential. A 24-year-old with the same numbers but poor personality and limited minutes probably won't.
