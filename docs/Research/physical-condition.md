# Research the physical condition attribute in Football Manager 2026. How does it work? How does it impact a players' ability and skill level? What causes it to rise and lower? Does it impact training at all, and if so, how?

Based on my extensive research into Football Manager 2026 and related versions, I can now provide a comprehensive answer about the physical condition attribute.

## Physical Condition in Football Manager 2026: A Comprehensive Guide

### What is Physical Condition?

Physical condition in Football Manager 2026 is formally called **Overall Physical Condition (OPC)** and represents a player's current fitness state. The system uses a numerical scale ranging from **1 to 10,000** internally, though the game displays this through **heart-shaped icons** on the tactics and squad screens. A bright green heart indicates peak condition (near 10,000), while red hearts indicate poor condition (near 5,000). The condition value will not typically fall below 5,000 unless a player is extremely exhausted immediately after a match.[^1][^2][^3]

### How Physical Condition Impacts Player Ability and Performance

Physical condition has substantial effects on player performance:

**Performance Impact**: Players at high OPC demonstrate superior performance during matches, while those at low OPC show significantly worse performance on the pitch. The difference is measurable—even a 10% reduction in condition can noticeably affect match ratings and overall effectiveness.[^3][^4][^1]

**Distance Covered**: Players at high OPC cover greater distances during matches, while those at low OPC cover less ground. This directly affects their ability to execute their tactical roles effectively.[^1]

**Attribute Expression**: When a player is in excellent condition, they are more alert, productive, and use their stats to full strength. Players in poor condition cannot fully express their technical and mental attributes.[^5][^6]

**Injury Risk**: The risk of injury during a match skyrockets when players compete at low OPC. Fresh players entering a match carry significantly lower injury risk than exhausted players.[^7][^8][^1]

### What Causes Condition to Rise and Fall

**Condition Depletion During Matches**:

- Players typically use between **15-20% OPC per half** during a match[^1]
- Starting at 100% condition, playing a full 90 minutes typically reduces condition to approximately **75%**[^8]
- There is always a small rebound in OPC at the end of both the first and second halves[^1]
- The amount of OPC spent depends on several factors including stamina, work rate, and tactical instructions[^1]

**Condition Recovery Between Matches**:
Condition recovery occurs at **midnight every day** (00:00 game time). The recovery rate depends on multiple factors:[^8][^1]

**Natural Fitness Attribute**: This is the most significant factor affecting recovery speed. Players with:[^9][^8][^1]

- 20 Natural Fitness recover condition to approximately **74%** after one day
- 10 Natural Fitness recover to approximately **68%**
- 1 Natural Fitness recover to approximately **66%**[^8]

**Match Sharpness**: Players at 100% match sharpness recover slightly better than those at 50% match sharpness, though the difference is relatively small.[^8]

**Training Workload**: Between matches, condition will recover more quickly if the player is given a lighter training workload or rest from training, but will recover more slowly if given a heavier workload.[^6]

**Recovery Methods**:

- Manual rest or "no pitch or gym work" provides the fastest OPC recovery—approximately **39% recovery over 3 days** from 50% starting condition[^10]
- Rest sessions recover approximately **29.3% over 3 days**[^10]
- Recovery sessions recover approximately **21.3% over 3 days**[^10]
- Standard training sessions provide less recovery depending on intensity[^10]
- Sending players on holiday provides the maximum recovery for fatigue[^10]

**It takes approximately 10 days for full recovery to 100% condition from post-match levels**.[^8]

**Long Periods Without Training**: Extended periods without training (injury, holiday, extended leave) will cause condition to fall, even if the player is rested. Natural Fitness also affects the rate at which condition falls during these periods.[^11][^6]

### The Role of Stamina vs. Natural Fitness

These two attributes play distinct but complementary roles:

**Stamina**: Indicates how **efficiently** a player spends OPC during a match.[^12][^1]

- Players with **high stamina** use less OPC for the same amount of work on the pitch[^1]
- Players with **low stamina** use more OPC for the same amount of work[^1]
- **Stamina does NOT affect condition recovery** post-match—it only affects condition usage during the match itself[^8]

**Natural Fitness**: Determines how quickly players recover OPC between matches.[^9][^11][^1]

- Players with high Natural Fitness recover faster after matches and training[^9]
- Helps players maintain their physical attributes past their peak years[^13]
- Helps avoid jadedness caused by playing games and completing training sessions[^11]

**Work Rate**: This attribute determines how much work a player does during a match, but says nothing about efficiency. Players with:[^1]

- **High work rate** do more work on the pitch and consequently use up more OPC throughout the match[^1]
- **Low work rate** do less work and use up less OPC[^1]


### Impact on Training

The relationship between physical condition and training is multifaceted:

**Training Gains**: While research suggests that condition itself doesn't directly prevent attribute development, players must maintain adequate condition levels to participate effectively in training. The training system functions more as a distribution mechanism for predetermined growth rather than a growth generator.[^14][^9]

**Training Intensity Settings**: The game provides options to adjust training intensity based on condition:[^15][^16]

- Players with poor fitness: **No pitch or gym work**
- Players with fairly bad fitness: **No pitch or gym work**
- Players with half fitness: **Half intensity**
- Fairly fit players: **Normal intensity**
- Fully fit players: **Double intensity**[^15]

**Recovery vs. Development Trade-off**: Higher training intensity can accelerate attribute development but comes at the cost of reduced condition recovery. Recovery sessions help maintain match sharpness better than rest sessions but provide less condition recovery.[^16][^10]

**Match Sharpness Maintenance**: Regular training, including match practice sessions, is necessary to keep match sharpness high, which in turn affects both in-game performance and recovery rates.[^7][^8][^1]

### Practical Management Recommendations

Based on the mechanics:

1. **Monitor OPC closely**: Use the heart icons to track player condition, aiming to start matches with players at full or near-full condition
2. **Prioritize Natural Fitness**: When recruiting, value Natural Fitness highly as it dramatically improves recovery between matches[^13][^8]
3. **Balance training and recovery**: Include adequate rest/recovery days in your training schedule, particularly after matches[^17][^10]
4. **Rotate strategically**: Given that it takes 10 days for full recovery, plan rotation to ensure key players have sufficient recovery time[^8]
5. **Adjust based on fixture congestion**: During busy periods with multiple matches per week, prioritize recovery over intensive training[^4][^16]

Physical condition is a critical but often underestimated aspect of Football Manager 2026 that significantly impacts match performance, injury risk, and squad management. Understanding its mechanics allows for more effective player rotation and training strategies throughout the season.
