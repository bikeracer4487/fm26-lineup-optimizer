## Positional Skill Ratings in Football Manager 2026

Positional skill ratings in FM26 are critical modifiers that directly impact player performance, operating on a 1-20 scale with distinct familiarity tiers that determine how effectively a player can execute their duties in specific positions.[^1][^2]

### **Impact on Player Ability and Performance**

Positional familiarity functions as a **direct penalty modifier** to a player's effective attributes when playing in positions they're less comfortable with. Research has quantified these performance impacts:[^3]

- **Natural (18-20)**: Full ability with no penalties
- **Accomplished (13-17)**: Approximately 10% reduction in effectiveness
- **Competent (10-12)**: Approximately 15% reduction in effectiveness
- **Unconvincing (6-9)**: Approximately 20% reduction in effectiveness
- **Awkward (5-8)**: Approximately 35% reduction in effectiveness
- **Ineffectual (1-4)**: Approximately 40% reduction in effectiveness

The penalties primarily affect **Positioning and Decisions** attributes, though all aspects of performance suffer when a player operates outside their comfort zone. A player rated 20 in any position experiences no adverse impact, while lower ratings progressively hamper performance.[^2][^1]

FM26 introduces enhanced position training mechanics where players can now become natural in new roles more quickly than previous versions. The new IP/OOP (In Possession/Out of Possession) system means positional familiarity affects both phases of play, with suitability depending on positional comfort and key attributes for each role.[^4][^5]

### **Time Required to Learn New Positions**

The timeline for position retraining varies significantly based on multiple factors:[^6][^7]

**General Timeline**:

- **6-9 months**: Reach basic competency (Competent rating) in a completely new position
- **12 months**: Achieve Natural familiarity (18-20 rating) in the new position
- Players can receive notification when ready to gain more match experience in the position[^8]

**Factors Affecting Learning Speed**:[^9][^10][^11]

1. **Versatility** (hidden attribute): Players with high Versatility (rated 1-20) adapt significantly faster, while those with low Versatility may struggle or never fully adapt[^10][^12][^13]
2. **Age**: Younger players adapt faster and retain positions longer; older players have increased difficulty learning new positions[^7][^1]
3. **Adaptability**: High adaptability accelerates the learning process[^1]
4. **Existing familiarity**: Players with some prior familiarity (even Awkward) learn faster than starting from zero[^14]
5. **Training workload**: Percentage of individual training dedicated to position training affects speed[^11]

### **Training vs Match Experience: When Each Matters**

Position learning requires **both training and match experience** working in tandem:[^8][^10]

**Training Phase**:

- Set individual training to the desired position/role under Development > Training[^15][^1]
- Training alone provides foundational familiarity but has limitations[^16]
- Position training can progress a player to approximately Competent level[^10][^8]

**Match Experience Requirement**:

- **Critical threshold**: Once a player reaches **Competent (12 rating)**, they typically need regular match experience to progress further[^7][^10]
- Training alone becomes insufficient for advancing beyond Competent[^16][^8]
- Players need actual game time in the position to reach Accomplished and Natural ratings[^8][^10]
- Even with training, you'll receive notifications that the player "needs to gain more experience" in the position through matches[^8]

**Optimal Approach**:[^10][^8]

1. Begin position training immediately in individual training
2. Gradually introduce match experience (friendlies → cup matches → competitive fixtures)
3. Combine both consistently: "If you combine first team appearances and training he will learn the position ultra fast"[^8]

### **Familiarity Retention: Does It Decline?**

This is one of the most debated aspects of FM's position system, with **conflicting evidence**:

**Evidence for Decline**:[^17][^18][^11]

- Trained positions **can deteriorate** if training stops, especially without regular match experience[^18][^11]
- Players can lose familiarity ratings they've gained through training if they stop practicing the position[^18]
- One case documented a player's familiarity in one position improving while simultaneously declining in another position they had previously trained[^17]
- "A player may lose familiarity with a trained position if the training is stopped, especially if he is not played in the position regularly"[^11]

**Evidence Against Decline**:[^19][^20]

- Natural positions that players start with (not trained) appear permanent and don't deteriorate[^19]
- Some players report trained positions staying Natural even after stopping training[^20]
- The debate centers on whether **trained positions** behave differently from **initial Natural positions**[^19]

**Best Practice**: To maintain position familiarity, especially for trained positions, continue either playing the player regularly in that position or keep position training active periodically. The decline risk appears highest for positions learned entirely through training without consistent match reinforcement.[^18][^11]

### **FM26-Specific Considerations**

FM26's revamped tactical system introduces additional nuances:[^21][^4]

- Players now learn specific roles within positions more effectively
- The IP/OOP split means players need familiarity for both phases of play[^5]
- Setting individual training to match the exact position/role/duty used in tactics maximizes tactical familiarity[^22][^23]
- Role familiarity in FM26 appears more important than in previous versions due to the new phase-based system[^21]

**Key Recommendation**: Train players in the **exact position, role, and duty** they'll play in your tactics for optimal results. The increased flexibility in FM26 means players can become Natural in new positions faster than before, particularly when combining targeted training with regular match experience.[^4][^22]
